#LinkedOut
_Linkedout is the place where job seekers share their interest for companies._

##The deets
- When visiting the site, a user should land on the index of all the companies. 
- The index should display the companies and links to their respective pages.
	- On each page, the user should be able to send a message to the company.
	- When a message is created, it will appear on the company's page.

- I've provided the code, but unfortunately it is broken :( 
Your job is to walk through the errors, knock them out and get the app working.
